          <h3>Usage Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Zillabooth is optimized for the handheld iPhone experience but now runs natively on iPad as well. The app provides a great experience on both iPhone and iPad devices.</li>
            <li>You'll notice that there are no color filters in Zillabooth. That's deliberate for speed, efficiency, and flexibility. Use whatever other filter app you want to - including the filters built into the Photos app on your device. Your photos are saved at the highest quality possible so that if you have the maximum amout of filtering and editing latitude.</li>
            <li>Individual images are auto-saved with as much metadata as possible, including portrait depth-mapping for portrait editing. The individual auto-saved images are the same or better quality than what the iPhone camera app takes with the selfie camera - so rest assured that while using Zillabooth, if one of the individual images is that "once in a lifetime" perfect shot, it will be saved as the same or better quality as if you had been using the native iPhone camera app.</li>
            <li>As you use the app, please let us know if you encounter any issues, or have any ideas or thoughts on it. The app is a work in progress, and we remain focused on delivering the most streamlined, useful, and fun app possible. Thank you for your consideration and support! Hello@Zillabooth.com</li>

        <h2>Pro Tips for Best Results</h2>
        
        <div class="tip">
          <h3>🎯 Perfect Timing</h3>
          <p>Use a 3-5 second start delay to give everyone time to get in position. 2-3 second intervals between shots work well for most groups.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
          <h3>💡 Lighting Matters</h3>
          <p>Good lighting is key! Natural light works best, but the built-in screen flash helps in darker environments. Avoid backlighting for best results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
          <h3>📱 Device Setup</h3>
          <p>Use a tripod or phone stand for professional results. This keeps your device steady and allows you to join in the photos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
          <h3>🎨 Customize for Your Event</h3>
          <p>Match your background color to your event theme. Wedding? Try elegant whites or pastels. Birthday party? Go bold with bright colors!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
          <h3>📸 Group Dynamics</h3>
          <p>For large groups, position people in a semi-circle around the camera. Smaller groups can get closer for more intimate shots.</p>

        <h2><a href="#party"></a>ZillaBooth Party Setup Guide</h2>a></h2>
        <p>ZillaBooth Party is a subscription service that unlocks powerful event-focused features designed for professional photo booth setups. All Party features work seamlessly together to create a streamlined, hands-off experience perfect for weddings, corporate events, parties, and gatherings. This guide will walk you through each feature in detail.</p>
        
        <div class="party-feature-section">
          <h3>📱 iPad Party Layout</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> The iPad Party Layout provides a special overlay-style interface optimized for iPad devices. Instead of the standard layout, this mode displays buttons and controls overlaid on the camera preview, creating a more immersive experience with the shutter button always positioned at the bottom for easy access.</p>
          
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> When you're using an iPad with ZillaBooth Party enabled, the app automatically switches to this special layout. The camera preview expands to fill more of the screen, and all controls are positioned as overlays, ensuring buttons are always accessible regardless of device orientation.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Large events where you want maximum screen space for the camera preview, making it easier for guests to see themselves and position correctly for photos.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Implementation notes:</strong> This layout is automatically enabled on iPad when Party features are active. No additional configuration is needed - just subscribe to Party and use your iPad!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="party-feature-section">
          <h3>🎨 PNG Graphic Overlay</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Add custom graphics, logos, text, or decorative elements to your photo collages. The overlay image is applied on top of the final collage, allowing you to brand your photos with event names, logos, hashtags, or any custom design.</p>
          
          <p><strong>How to set it up:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open ZillaBooth settings and navigate to the Party features section</li>
            <li>Find "Graphic Overlay" and tap to open the setup view</li>
            <li>Tap "Select Graphic File" to browse for a PNG file on your device</li>
            <li>Choose a PNG image with transparency (supports alpha channel)</li>
            <li>The app will automatically copy the file to ZillaBooth's documents folder and display a preview</li>
            <li>Once selected, the overlay will be automatically applied to all future collages</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Important technical details:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>File format:</strong> Only PNG files are supported (required for transparency)</li>
            <li><strong>Image dimensions:</strong> For best results, use an overlay image that matches the dimensions of your final collage output. To determine the exact size you need, take a test photo session and check the dimensions of the saved collage image</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> PNG files with alpha channels work best - the overlay will be stretched to fit the collage size</li>
            <li><strong>File storage:</strong> Selected overlay files are automatically copied into ZillaBooth's documents folder, so you can safely delete the original file</li>
            <li><strong>Quality optimization:</strong> ZillaBooth automatically optimizes image quality based on your device's capabilities</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Branding events with logos, adding event hashtags, creating custom frames or borders, adding decorative elements to match your event theme.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Removing the overlay:</strong> To remove the overlay, return to the Graphic Overlay setup view and deselect the file. The overlay will be cleared from all future collages.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="party-feature-section">
          <h3>📤 Simplified Sharing</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Simplified Sharing streamlines the photo delivery process for events.

          <h3>🖨️ Auto-Print</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Automatically print each collage to a configured AirPrint printer immediately after sharing. This feature works seamlessly with Simplified Sharing to create a complete hands-off experience - guests receive their photos both digitally and as instant prints.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplified Sharing must be enabled</li>
            <li>An AirPrint-compatible printer must be configured</li>
            <li>Device must support AirPrint (check availability in settings)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>How to set it up:</strong></p>

            <li>The print job happens in the background - no additional user interaction is needed</li>
            <li>If the printer is unavailable, the app will retry up to 3 times with increasing delays</li>
            <li>Print status is logged for troubleshooting</li>
            <li>The app monitors printer availability and will alert if the printer becomes unavailable</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>The app automatically monitors your printer connection every 30 seconds</li>

            <li>Print jobs will queue and retry when the printer comes back online</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Guest experience:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Guest takes photos and sees their collage</li>
            <li>Guest taps "Send & Print" (instead of just "Send")</li>
            <li>Guest enters their contact information</li>
            <li>Guest sends the message/email</li>
            <li>Collage automatically prints to the configured printer</li>
            <li>Guest receives both digital and printed copies</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Events where you want instant physical prints alongside digital delivery. Perfect for weddings, corporate events, or any gathering where guests expect to take home a printed photo.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Auto-Print requires Simplified Sharing to be enabled</li>

          <h3>🔄 Auto-Restart</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Automatically returns to the camera view after a period of inactivity, ensuring the photo booth is always ready for the next guest. This feature eliminates the need to manually restart the app after each photo session.</p>
          
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>After a collage is displayed, a 5-minute timer begins</li>
            <li>If no interaction occurs for 5 minutes, the app automatically returns to the camera view</li>
            <li>The timer resets if the user interacts with the collage (taps share, views settings, etc.)</li>
            <li>This ensures the photo booth is always ready for the next guest without manual intervention</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>How to enable:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open ZillaBooth settings and navigate to Party features</li>
            <li>Enable "Auto-Restart" toggle</li>
            <li>The feature is immediately active - no additional configuration needed</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Timeout settings:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The timeout is fixed at 5 minutes (300 seconds)</li>
            <li>This duration gives guests enough time to view and share their photos while ensuring quick turnover</li>
            <li>The timer only counts idle time - any interaction resets it</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Unattended or semi-attended photo booths where you want the app to automatically reset between guests. Perfect for events where guests are using the photo booth independently.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The timer starts when the collage is first displayed</li>
            <li>Any user interaction (tapping buttons, viewing settings) resets the timer</li>
            <li>If a guest is actively using the app, the timer won't trigger</li>
            <li>Works seamlessly with Auto-Print and Simplified Sharing</li>

          <h3>🔋 Keep Awake</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Prevents your device from automatically sleeping during events, ensuring the photo booth is always ready and the screen stays on. This feature uses iOS Guided Access to keep the device awake and locked to the ZillaBooth app.</p>
          
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
          <p>ZillaBooth uses iOS Guided Access, a built-in accessibility feature, to keep your device awake and prevent accidental app switching. This is the most reliable method for ensuring uninterrupted photo booth operation during events.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Step-by-step setup:</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Long events where you need the device to stay on continuously without manual intervention. Essential for unattended photo booths or events lasting several hours.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Heat management:</strong> Extended use may cause the device to warm up. Ensure adequate ventilation</li>
            <li><strong>Screen brightness:</strong> Consider reducing screen brightness to save battery and reduce heat</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Always test Guided Access setup before your event to ensure everything works correctly</li>
            <li><strong>Remember your passcode:</strong> You'll need the Guided Access passcode to exit the mode</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If Guided Access won't start, ensure it's enabled in Settings</li>
            <li>If the device still sleeps, check that Auto-Lock is set to "Never" in Guided Access Time Limits</li>
            <li>If you forget your passcode, you can reset it in Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access</li>

          <h3>🔒 Hide Settings Button</h3>
          <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Hides the settings button from the camera screen, preventing guests from accessing app settings during events. This feature works hand-in-hand with Guided Access to create a locked-down, event-ready experience.</p>
          
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>When enabled, the settings button is completely hidden from the camera interface</li>
            <li>This prevents guests from accidentally changing settings or accessing app configuration</li>
            <li>The button is hidden only when the camera is active (not during countdown or when viewing collages)</li>
            <li>Settings can still be accessed from the iOS Settings app if needed</li>

          <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>This feature is designed to work with Guided Access for complete event lock-down</li>
            <li>When enabled, guests cannot access settings, which helps maintain consistent event configuration</li>
            <li>To access settings yourself, you'll need to disable this feature temporarily or use the iOS Settings app</li>
            <li>The settings button is automatically hidden during countdown and when viewing collages regardless of this setting</li>
